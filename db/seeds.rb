    place_of_birth: "Cold Lake, Alberta", country: "Canada", description: "Wolverine was born, James Howlett, in Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada, during the late 1880s, to rich farm owners John and Elizabeth Howlett.[29] However, as the 'Origin' miniseries insinuates and the Wolverine Goes to Hell story, later, fully revealed, he is actually the illegitimate son of the Howletts' groundskeeper, Thomas Logan.[30] After being thrown off the Howletts' property for an attempted rape perpetrated by his other son, named simply Dog, Thomas returns to the Howlett manor and kills John Howlett. In retaliation, young James kills Thomas with bone claws that emerge from the back of his hands, as his mutation manifests (a traumatic event in one's youth is often the trigger for the manifestation of mutant powers). Consequently, James is cast out by his mother (who subsequently commits suicide).[31] He flees with his childhood companion, Rose (who closely resembles Jean Grey) and grows into manhood on a mining colony in the Yukon Territory, adopting the name 'Logan'.[32] After accidentally killing Rose with his claws, Logan leaves the colony and lives in the wilderness, among wolves.[33] After the wolves are killed, Logan is captured and serves in a circus.[34] However, Saul Creed (Victor Creed's brother) frees Logan. After Creed betrays Logan and Clara Creed's location to Nathaniel Essex, Logan drowns Creed in Essex's potion. It is assumed this murder is the cause of Sabretooth's obsessive rivalry with Logan.[35] Later, Logan returns to civilization, residing with the Blackfoot people. Following the death of his Blackfoot lover, Silver Fox, at the hands of Sabretooth,[36] he is ushered into the Canadian military during World War I. Logan then spends some time in Madripoor, before settling in Japan, where he marries Itsu and has a son, Daken that initially Logan doesn't know about.", height: 180, weight: 82, eyes: "brown", hair: "brown")
